<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Howdy, I'm Brint! I am getting my bachelors in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M. </a>
  My passions are in quantum computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.  
  Ever since I first started learning the very basics of programming in my freshman year of high school, via Scratch, 
  I have found a passion that deepens with each language I learn and the depth to which I learn other languages. 
  The multitude of problems and solutions that lies within computer engineering is what drives my love for all 
  of the aspects of computer hardware and software. Many different programs drove my interest into this field when 
  I was younger. An example is the Japanese bakery artificial intelligence, by Hisashi Kambe, aptly named "BakeryScan"  
  that was originally made to identify different types of pastries and keep the process of checking out more hygienic, 
  which you can read about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-pastry-ai-that-learned-to-fight-cancer">here.</a>
  However, it was realized the system was not only good for bread, but instead it could be used for a many number of things. 
  One of these things was it's ability to identify cancer cells with a stunningly high accuracy. Innovations like this inspired 
  me to the uses of computer engineering and the benefits it could have for all of society. My hope is to use this field 
  to further develop and research into hardware and software for quantum computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence 
  that can help people, like the artificial intelligence "BakeryScan" ended up doing. With my years of coding experience, passion, 
  and drive for computer engineering I am here to make a difference in the world of computer engineering. Whether that be in all of 
  the specific fields I am passionate or just one I am striving to learn as much as I can and eventually find research into something that can make a difference.</p>

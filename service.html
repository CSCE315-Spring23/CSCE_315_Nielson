            <h3>My Community Contributions</h3>
            <p>Growing up, I had an interest in contributing to my community. My father is a volunteer firefighter at <a
                    href="https://cyfairfd.org/" target="_blank">Cy-Fair Fire Department</a> and he helped teach me the
                value in helping those in need. Throughout high school, I would regularly volunteer with the fire
                station and
                was formally trained
                and am CPR certified. I also would regularly participate in suicide-prevention marathons to help raise
                awareness.
                <br><br>One thing that I also worked for in my community was helping those who were struck bad by
                Hurricane
                Harvey.
                My mother, friends, and I worked to give a helping hand for those who needed anything ranging from
                helping move damaged items to
                helping knock out damaged walls.
                <br><br>Life guarding was also another way that I felt that I contributed to my community- making sure
                the
                public was able to safely
                enjoy time with their loved ones at the pool.

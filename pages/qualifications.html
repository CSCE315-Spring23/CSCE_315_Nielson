<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>8 years of coding experience overall.</p>

<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was deeply interested in space and its potential future. 
    This led me to want to pursue a future in aerospace engineering. 
However as I started learning programming and more about computers I became 
sure that what I wanted to do in the future was tied with computers.
As I learned more I became more passionate towards artificial intelligence
and it's potential. Although artificial intelligence has become my main Interest
I am still impassioned towards space as well as some other subjects like quantum computing.

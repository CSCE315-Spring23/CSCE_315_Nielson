        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I had the pleasure of joining a research project through my university that worked on devoloping self
            sufficient
            space habitats.
            The team was comprised of students of diverse majors under the guidance of Dr. Rising. All of the
            components of an established civilzation were considered as well as some creative aspects, such as the
            ability
            to transplant habitats and
            to regulate climate to different parts of the habitat. My direct contribution was to deal with space debris
            avoidance as well as establish a waste management system. </p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I had the pleasure of joining a research project through my university that developed self sufficient space habitats.
 The team was comprised of students of diverse majors under the guidance of Dr. Rising. All of the 
components of an established civilzation were considered as well as some creative aspects, such as the ability to transplant habitats and 
to regulate climate to differnt parts of the habitat. My direct contribution was to establish a waste management system as well as space debris avoidance.  </p>

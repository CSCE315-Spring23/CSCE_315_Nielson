            <h3>Interest</h3>
            <p>Growing up, I was deeply interested in space and its potential future.
                This led me to want to pursue a future in aerospace engineering.
                However as I started learning programming and more about computers I became
                sure that what I wanted to do in the future was tied with computers.
                As I learned more I became more passionate towards artificial intelligence
                and it's potential. Although artificial intelligence has become my main Interest
                I am still impassioned towards space as well as some other subjects like quantum computing.
